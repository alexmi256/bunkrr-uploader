## Details
### Duplicate Files
If you try to upload a file and it already exists then the upload will be skipped. This comparison is based on MD5 sums,
This check is based on the account being used. You can upload the same file twice to an account if different directories were specified.

### History
Configs are stored in `$HOME/.config/bunkrr_upload/config.json` and all successful uploads and md5 sum hashes will be saved in there.
Each time you complete an upload a `bunkrr_upload_<timestamp>.csv` will be created with the items uploaded and the following metadata:
`filePath,filePathMD5,fileNameMD5,uploadSuccess,code,downloadPage,fileId,fileName,guestToken,md5,parentFolder`

## Examples
Given
```
directory/
├── sample2.mkv
└── sample.mkv
```
**Upload single file anonymously**

`bunkrr-upload directory/sample.mkv`

**Upload single file to your account**

`bunkrr-upload --token 123 foo directory/sample.mkv`

**Upload single file to directory `foo` in your account**

`bunkrr-upload --token 123 --folder foo directory/sample.mkv`

**Upload directory to your account**

`bunkrr-upload --token 123 directory`

**Upload directory to directory `foo` in your account**

`bunkrr-upload --token 123 --folder foo directory`

# Development
## Optional Prerequesites
- tk `sudo pacman -S base-devel tk just`
- [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#set-up-your-shell-environment-for-pyenv)
- [pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-as-a-pyenv-plugin)

```bash
pyenv install 3.9
```

## Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pre-commit install
```

## Packaging
This package currently uses [just](https://github.com/casey/just which is a Makefile like utility.

You must install `just` first and then you can do things like `just build` or `just release` which depend on the `justfile` to take actions.
